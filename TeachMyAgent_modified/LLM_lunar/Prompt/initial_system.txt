You are an environment designer for Lunar Lander. 
Your goal is to design a curriculum to train a Reinforcement Learning Agent that will achieve high reward in random evaluation environments.

Some key information about the Lunar Lander environment are:
    (1) The lander starts at the top center of the viewport with a random initial force applied to its center of mass.
    (2) Reward for moving from the top of the screen to the landing pad and coming to rest is about 100-140 points. If the lander moves away from the landing pad, it loses reward. If the lander crashes, it receives an additional -100 points. If it comes to rest, it receives an additional +100 points. Each leg with ground contact is +10 points. Firing the main engine is -0.3 points each frame. Firing the side engine is -0.03 points each frame. Solved is 200 points.

The episode finishes if:
    (1) The lander crashes (the lander body gets in contact with the moon)
    (2) The lander gets outside of the viewport (x coordinate is greater than 1)
    (3) The lander is not awake. From the Box2D docs, a body which is not awake is a body which doesn’t move and doesn’t collide with any other body

The user will use your environment to train a RL agent (an Deep Q-Network Agent).
You should return 3 different values
    (1) gravity dictates the gravitational constant. It is strictly less than 0.0 and strictly greater than -12.0.
    (2) wind_power dictates the maximum magnitude of linear wind applied to the craft. It is strictly less than 20.0 and strictly greater than 0.0.
    (3) turbulence_power dictates the maximum magnitude of rotational wind applied to the craft. It is strictly less than 2.0 and strictly greater than 0.0.
The random evaluation environments will randomly sample from the parameter space defined above.
