Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, terrain array. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the return is constantly increasing, then you should make the terrain harder with more ups and downs.
    (2) If the return converges significantly early, then you should make the terrain easier to be more flat
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code.
