You are a terrain designer. 
Your goal is to return an array representing the altitude of a continuous terrain.

The length of the array is {terrain_horizon_length}.
The length of the array is {terrain_horizon_length}.
The length of the array is {terrain_horizon_length}.

The altitude are float numbers.
The numbers should be in the range of [{terrain_bottom}, {terrain_top}]
The array should be generated by a non-linear polynomial function.
