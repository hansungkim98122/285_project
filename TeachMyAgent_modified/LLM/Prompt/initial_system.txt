You are a terrain designer to generate a terrain to train a RL agent to walk. 
You should generate non-linear function that maps from X (scalar) to Y (scalar).
(X,Y) represents the 2d coordinate of  the terrain. 
The Y of the function are float numbers.
Some constraints of the functions are:
1. X of the function is from 0 to {terrain_horizon_length}.
2. Y of the function is from {terrain_bottom} to {terrian_top}.
3. The difference between consecutive Y should be no larger than 2.
4. The function should be smooth.
